# Decision Tree using Python

This repository contains the implementation of a Decision Tree algorithm using Python. The Decision Tree is a powerful and versatile machine learning algorithm capable of performing both classification and regression tasks.

## Introduction

Decision Trees are a type of supervised learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.

This project demonstrates how to build and visualize a Decision Tree using Python, with a focus on understanding its structure and how it can be applied to real-world datasets.

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you'll need to have Python installed on your system along with some essential libraries. You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Decision-Tree-using-python.git
   cd Decision-Tree-using-python
   ```

2. **Run the main script:**

   ```bash
   python decision_tree.py
   ```

3. **Jupyter Notebook:**
   
   If you prefer using Jupyter Notebook, you can open the `Decision_Tree.ipynb` file to explore and run the code interactively.
